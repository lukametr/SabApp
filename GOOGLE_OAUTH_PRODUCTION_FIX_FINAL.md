# Google OAuth Production Fix - Final Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Production Google OAuth Flow

**Problem**: Google OAuth was still trying to use popup/FedCM flow in production, causing these errors:

- `[GSI_LOGGER]: FedCM get() rejects with AbortError: signal is aborted without reason`
- `Provider's accounts list is empty`
- `[GSI_LOGGER]: FedCM get() rejects with NetworkError: Error retrieving a token`

**Solution**: Updated `apps/frontend/src/components/Navigation.tsx` to:

- Skip Google API popup initialization entirely in production
- Use consistent production detection logic (`!localhost && !127.0.0.1`)
- Only initialize popup-based Google Sign-In in development
- Use pure OAuth2 redirect flow in production

### 2. Improved Environment Detection

- Added consistent production detection across both initialization and sign-in handlers
- Added debug logging to show environment detection details
- Ensured both development and production flows are clearly separated

### 3. Backend OAuth Callback

- Confirmed backend has proper OAuth2 callback endpoints (`GET` and `POST /auth/google/callback`)
- Backend properly handles authorization code exchange
- Proper error handling and user registration flow

## Files Modified

- `apps/frontend/src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Fixed production OAuth flow

## How It Works Now

### Development (localhost)

1. Google API is initialized with popup mode
2. `handleCustomGoogleSignIn()` uses `window.google.accounts.id.prompt()`
3. Popup-based OAuth flow

### Production (saba-app-production.up.railway.app)

1. Google API is NOT initialized (no popup setup)
2. `handleCustomGoogleSignIn()` redirects to Google OAuth URL
3. Google redirects back to `/auth/google/callback`
4. Frontend callback page sends code to backend
5. Backend exchanges code for tokens

## Next Steps Required

1. **Update Google Cloud Console** (MANUAL):
   - Add `https://saba-app-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback` to authorized redirect URIs
   - Add `https://saba-app-production.up.railway.app` to authorized JavaScript origins

2. **Test the flow** after Google Console update

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- No more FedCM errors in production
- Clean redirect-based OAuth flow
- Proper error handling and registration flow
- Development continues to work with popup

The application should now work correctly in production once the Google Cloud Console is updated.
