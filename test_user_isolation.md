# User Data Isolation Test

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. User Registration Process:

âœ… **User Creation**: When a user registers via Google OAuth:

- User is created in `users` collection with unique `_id`
- User has fields: `googleId`, `email`, `personalNumber`, `phoneNumber`, etc.

### 2. Document Creation Process:

âœ… **Document Storage**: When user creates a document:

- Document is saved in `documents` collection
- Document has `authorId` field pointing to user's `_id`
- Document contains: `authorId`, `evaluatorName`, `objectName`, `hazards`, etc.

### 3. Data Isolation Implementation:

âœ… **Database Level Isolation**:

```typescript
// Document creation
const createdDocument = new this.documentModel({
  ...createDocumentDto,
  authorId: userId, // Links document to specific user
});

// Document retrieval
const filter = { authorId: userId }; // Only user's documents
const documents = await this.documentModel.find(filter).exec();

// Single document access
const filter = { _id: id, authorId: userId }; // User can only access own documents
```

### 4. Security Measures:

âœ… **Authorization Requirements**:

- All document endpoints require `JwtAuthGuard`
- User must be authenticated to access any document operation
- `userId` is extracted from JWT token: `req.user?.id || req.user?.sub`

âœ… **Access Control**:

- `findAll()`: Returns only documents where `authorId = userId`
- `findOne()`: Requires both document ID and author match
- `update()`: Can only update own documents
- `delete()`: Can only delete own documents
- `download()`: Can only download own documents

## Conclusion:

ðŸ”’ **USER ISOLATION IS PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED**

Each user has their own "virtual folder" in the database:

- User A can only see documents where `authorId = User_A_ID`
- User B can only see documents where `authorId = User_B_ID`
- No shared access between users
- Complete data isolation at database query level

## Database Structure:

```
users collection:
{
  _id: "user_123",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  ...
}

documents collection:
{
  _id: "doc_456",
  authorId: "user_123", // Links to specific user
  objectName: "Building A",
  hazards: [...],
  ...
}
```

This ensures each user only sees their own documents.
